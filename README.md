# ChatShowcase

This is a simple chat application that showcases a single message thread using Android's ViewModels and LiveData. 

Currently non-user messages are completely mocked via double tapping on the send button. Eventually I want to build out a backend which this app can connect to via a websocket which will replace these mocked messages.
